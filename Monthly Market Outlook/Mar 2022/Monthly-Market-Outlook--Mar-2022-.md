# Monthly Review

The month of February has been a hectic month for financial markets; most notably, the initial tensions between Ukraine and Russia have culminated into a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. Markets as a whole have sold off since then, as investors, who are unsure about the implications of this crisis, accelerate their efforts to de-risk their investment portfolios.

Accordingly, given this difficult period, there will be no expected market sector return rankings for this edition of our market outlook. **Instead, we strongly urge investors to remain invested.** While one might be successful in trying to time the market by scaling up on one's active monitoring efforts of the markets, a considerable amount of effort is needed, given the fluidity of the situation. In addition, there are numerous challenges when it comes to timing the market.

The following tables compare the frequencies and probabilities of outperformance of various ETFs serving as proxies for various market indices across varying investment holding period lengths, through time. The tables display the probability of each index registering a positive return if the investment is made at any given prior point in time, and held for the duration of the period length. A probability of outperformance represents the probability of registering a positive return, while a probability of underperformance represents the probability of registering a negative return.

## iShares MSCI World ETF

The virtues of remaining invested can be clearly seen; across the varying holding period lengths, there is a greater likelihood of the index registering a positive return, than a negative return. Furthermore, it is mostly the case that as the holding period length increases, the probability of the index registering a positive return increases.

**We would again like to advocate for investors to remain invested; being led by fear and offloading positions hastily only realize a loss for investors. In addition, given the fluid situation, there is a very low likelihood of benefiting from market timing strategies.**

We continue to await for the latest stream of economic data, which will be released through March, to guide our expectations for the next month.
